It's got something like Olivia on it. Something like Olivia. Born and Raised, I think is the record it was on. He's gone through so many different phases in his career. He's bopped in and out of every musical genre you can be in. He's done it all. He's obviously one of the top five guitar players of all time, and I think he's a better songwriter than he is a guitar player. And it's like, you know, it's, he's just this person who transcends what we call music. He's just so far on his own level that it is nearly inhuman, you know. It's like just something totally different that, that we're just kind of lucky to be existing at the same time. So this is a song by John Mayer."
